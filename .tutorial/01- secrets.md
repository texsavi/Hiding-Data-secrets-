# For Your Eyes Only
**We are back to the good stuff again!**

Sometimes, we need to store information in our code that we don't want others to be able to see. Like passwords and such.

Replit repls are *public*, and we don't want other little forkers to get their hands on our passwords, do we?

ðŸ‘‰ We can make information like this secret in our repls by selecting 'secrets' from the left hand toolbar.

ðŸ‘‰ Secrets are a lot like **dictionaries** in that they have a key which is used to access a value.  Let's set up a password secret.

As soon as we've done that, we get a bunch of options further down our secrets menu. They use the `os` library, so we'll need to import that.

ðŸ‘‰ Now let's use our secret to set up a very simple login system.

```python
import os

password = os.environ['password'] # Uses the os library to talk to the environment and get the secret password stored there.

userPass = input("Password > ")

if userPass == password:
  print("Well done")
else:
  print("Better luck next time")
```

The secret data **does not get copied when the repl is forked**, so it is protected from others getting a copy.
